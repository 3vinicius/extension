#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The project's idea was to create an extension for automating connections on LinkedIn. The project was developed using HTML and JavaScript, along with Chrome APIs to facilitate communication between the application and the webpage. By capturing the HTML of the page, it becomes possible to identify the connect buttons and, consequently, automate connections. Additionally, the extension was customized using pure CSS.
